Portal for Ragging and Bullying Complaints.
Almost 80% of the students in an institution undergo ragging in their first few months in a university. Many of them arenâ€™t able to deal with it, which leads to unfortunate circumstances. What can help these students would be an application which allows them to fill a form which would be sent to the respective in-charge regarding the student's personal details, date, time and place where they have been subjected to ragging/bullying so that necessary action can be taken.
